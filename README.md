Web application presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until
now. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the
selected year.

Design was inspired by retro F1 posters.

## Installation

To install the application, clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sadaskeanu/f1.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:

### `npm install`

## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
